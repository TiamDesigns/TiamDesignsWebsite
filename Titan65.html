            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The Titan65 is a premium custom mechanical keyboard project managed by Phase Studio, a design collective
              co-founded by myself and Logan Smith.
              Born from a passion for enthusiast peripherals, this project evolved from a concept into a successful
              international Group Buy (GB).
            </p>
            <p>
              My role was multifaceted, bridging the gap between design and production. I was responsible for the
              **plate design**, **mounting system**, and **manufacturing quality control**, ensuring the final product
              met strict industry standards.
              While Logan led the exterior CAD modeling, I focused on the internal engineering, component sourcing, and
              vendor management.

    <!-- Phase 1: Design & Prototyping -->
    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Phase 1: Design & Prototyping</h2>
        <div class="two-col-grid">
          <div>
            <h3>Engineering & Standards</h3>
            <p>
              I designed the **plate and mounting system** to provide a consistent typing feel and sound profile, a
              critical factor for enthusiasts.
              I also ensured all board dimensions met rigorous industry standards for switch and stabilizer
              compatibility.
            </p>
            <p>
              Working with <strong>RapidDirect</strong>, we ordered multiple rounds of prototypes to perfect these
              geometries.
            </p>
            <p>
              We experimented with a variety of finishes and materials to maximize the board's aesthetic and acoustic
              properties:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Aluminum Cases:</strong> Tested in White, Black, Blue, Purple, Yellow, and raw aluminum.</li>
              <li><strong>Brass Bases:</strong> A clear-coated brass weight was designed to add heft and a premium feel.
              </li>
              <li><strong>Finishes:</strong> We evaluated bead-blasted anodization, electrophoretic coating (e-coating)
                for smoother finishes, and passivation for the brass components.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Component Sourcing & QC</h3>
            <p>
              I personally specified and sourced the critical components, including M3/M2 screws, hotswap sockets, and
              custom 40-50 Shore A silicone gaskets.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Quality Control Challenges:</strong> The prototyping phase wasn't without its hurdles. We faced
              incorrectly milled lettering, color matching issues (specifically with yellow Pantone shades), and
              dimensional offsets.
              Deep discussions were held regarding the brass passivation, which initially showed watermarks and
              oxidation spots. We investigated UV painting as an alternative to ensure a flawless finish.

        <h2>Phase 2: Manufacturing & Sourcing</h2>
        <p>
          This phase involved securing reliable partners to bring the Titan65 to mass production.

            <h3>Case Manufacturing</h3>
            <p>
              <strong>RapidDirect</strong> remained our primary partner for CNC machining. I maintained constant
              communication with their team (specifically Tammy Tang and Nanno)
              to quote and manufacture the complex case geometries and plates.

            <h3>PCB Production & Diagnostics</h3>
            <p>
              We partnered with <strong>Dalian JY Electronics & Technology Co., Ltd.</strong> for the PCB manufacturing.
              I worked closely on the **board layout and diagnostics**, overseeing the assembly (PCBA) and firmware
              flashing.
              <br><br>
              <strong>The 'Recall' Moment:</strong> Initial tests revealed the PCBs were non-functional. I led the
              diagnostic process to identify the root cause, requiring an urgent rerouting of the board traces.
              This experience was a crash course in crisis management and rapid iteration.

        <h2>Phase 3: Group Buy & Distribution</h2>
        <p>
          The culmination of our work was the Group Buy launch on <strong>April 1, 2021</strong>. Originally slated for
          late 2020, we delayed the launch to ensure every manufacturing kink was ironed out.
        </p>
        <div class="two-col-grid">
          <div>
            <h3>Global Launch</h3>
            <p>
              The response was overwhelming. We sold over <strong>120 units</strong> in North America alone on the first
              day.
              Approximately 50% of orders included the premium brass base upgrade, validating our material choices.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
              Beyond logistics, I personally handled **customer support** for all our direct buyers, addressing
              technical questions and ensuring a smooth pre-order experience.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <h3>Logistics Network</h3>
            <p>
              To handle global distribution, we established a network of proxy vendors:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>CandyKeys</strong> (EU Distribution)</li>
              <li><strong>Deskhero</strong> (Canada)</li>
              <li><strong>Kono Store</strong> & <strong>iLumkb</strong> (International)</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.9em; color: var(--muted);">
              Managing this network required navigating complex logistics, including import taxes, duties, and
              coordinating freight shipments to ensure Q4 2021 delivery.
