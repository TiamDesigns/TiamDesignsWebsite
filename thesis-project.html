                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>
                            As other sports and recreational activities receive an increasing amount of support for the
                            health and safety of athletes, dancers often receive little to none. There is a common
                            presumption that dancing is merely a leisurely activity; however, professional dancers
                            frequently require extensive physical therapy due to high injury incidence rates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This thesis proposes a solution to help deter the occurrence rate of injuries in young
                            professional dancers through augmented education, combining wearable technology with a smart
                            environment.

                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            Dance involves many repetitive motions that can cause injuries to cascade over time.
                            Unless measures are taken to reduce these rates, many young dancers face long-term physical
                            consequences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Dancers often lack real-time feedback on their bio-mechanics
                            during practice, leading to poor form habits that cause injury.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <h3>User Research</h3>
                        <p>
                            Interviews with dancers and instructors revealed that while instructors correct form, they
                            cannot be everywhere at once. Dancers practicing alone often reinforce bad habits
                            unknowingly.

                    <h3>User Personas</h3>
                    <p>
                        To understand the needs of the target audience, specific personas were developed representing
                        the young professional dancer and the dance instructor.

                    <h3>Empathy & Journey Mapping</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mapping the dancer's journey through a typical practice session highlighted key pain points
                        where fatigue and lack of supervision led to injury risks.

                            <strong>Smart leggings</strong> embedded with sensors track muscle engagement and alignment
                            in real-time. This wearable technology provides haptic feedback to the dancer, correcting
                            posture before injuries occur.

                        1:1 scale studies were conducted to ensure the wearables fit diverse body types without
                        restricting movement. The placement of sensors was critical to capture accurate muscle data.

                    <p>
                        This project focused on conceptual research and formal development. <strong>Fusion360</strong>
                        was used for hard-surface modeling of the floor panels, while <strong>CLO3D</strong> was
                        utilized to simulate the fabric physics and fit of the smart leggings.

                    <p>
                        Physical study models were developed to test the ergonomics, modularity, and durability of the
                        system. This project was a conceptual exploration of future dance education technology and did
                        not involve functional electronics prototyping.
