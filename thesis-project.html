                        <p>
                            Dance is a timeless representation of art and music expressed through the movement of the
                            body.
                            Many young girls turn to dance as a recreational sport or extracurricular activity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, there is a presumption that dancing is merely a leisurely activity. In reality, it
                            involves
                            intense physical exertion. Research shows that <strong>81% of dancers report injuries within
                                their first year of learning</strong>,
                            and 58% suffer a substantial injury affecting both performance and daily tasks. These
                            injuries can have a cascading
                            effect that impacts their adult lives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This thesis proposes a solution to deter injury occurrence rates in young professional
                            dancers through augmented education,
                            combining wearable technology with a smart environment.

                <h2>Research & Problem Definition</h2>

                    <div>
                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            The risk of dance injuries for learning students is extremely high. Knee, back, and
                            ankle-related injuries
                            can severely impact an individual's life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dance injuries are often overlooked compared to other sports injuries. Although therapy is
                            similar,
                            <strong>prevention is often neglected</strong>. Primary injuries can cascade into long-term
                            pain and disability.
                            Current aids for dancers often focus only on joint strain or require expensive,
                            space-consuming installations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Dancers often lack real-time feedback on their bio-mechanics
                            during practice, leading to poor form habits that cause injury.
                        </p>

                    <h3>Categorization of Needs</h3>
                    <p>
                        Three categories of needs were identified: <strong>Wants & Wishes</strong>, <strong>Latent
                            Needs</strong>, and <strong>Immediate Needs</strong>.
                        Immediate needs include parental support, better movement indicators, and consistent practice.
                        Latent needs revealed a strong desire for communication between
                        teachers, therapists, and students, which often lacked intimacy.

                        Current products fail to meet the needs for <strong>communication and indication</strong>.
                        Teachers often struggle to assist all students uniquely due to large class sizes.
                        Solutions that clearly portray movement indicators or allow teachers to review performance are
                        critical.

                        Four distinct personas were recognized: the dancers themselves, dance teachers, parents, and
                        physiotherapists. Their interactions are deeply intertwined.

                            pushing themselves physically.
                            These students often seek social activities but may aim for professional careers,
                            leading to overuse injuries.

                            prevent injury and ensure safe practice,
                            but with hundreds of students, individual attention is challenging.
