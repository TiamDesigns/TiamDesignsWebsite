                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Dance is a timeless representation of art and music expressed through the movement of the
                        body. Many turn to dance as a recreational sport or extracurricular activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there is a presumption that dancing is merely a leisurely activity. In reality, it
                        involves intense physical exertion. Research shows that <strong>81% of dancers report injuries
                            within their first year of learning</strong>, and 58% suffer a substantial injury affecting
                        both performance and daily tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This thesis proposes a solution to deter injury occurrence rates in young professional
                        dancers through augmented education, combining <strong>wearable technology</strong> with a
                        <strong>smart environment</strong>.

                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            The risk of dance injuries for learning students is extremely high. Knee, back, and
                            ankle-related injuries
                            can severely impact an individual's life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Dance injuries are often overlooked compared to other sports injuries. Although therapy is
                            similar,
                            <strong>prevention is often neglected</strong>. Primary injuries can cascade into long-term
                            pain and disability.
                            Current aids for dancers often focus only on joint strain or require expensive,
                            space-consuming installations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Dancers often lack real-time feedback on their bio-mechanics
                            during practice, leading to poor form habits that cause injury.
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        Three categories of needs were identified: <strong>Wants & Wishes</strong>, <strong>Latent
                            Needs</strong>, and <strong>Immediate Needs</strong>.
                        Immediate needs include parental support, better movement indicators, and consistent practice.
                        Latent needs revealed a strong desire for communication between
                        teachers, therapists, and students, which often lacked intimacy.

                        Current products fail to meet the needs for <strong>communication and indication</strong>.
                        Teachers often struggle to assist all students uniquely due to large class sizes.
                        Solutions that clearly portray movement indicators or allow teachers to review performance are
                        critical.

                        physiotherapists. Their interactions are deeply intertwined.

                            <strong>Jennifer White (15-18)</strong> represents the learning dancer who starts
                            pushing themselves physically.
                            These students often seek social activities but may aim for professional careers,
                            leading to overuse injuries.

                            prevent injury and ensure safe practice,
                            but with hundreds of students, individual attention is challenging.

                <h2>Ideation & Concepts</h2>
                <p>
                    Concept exploration focused on the leggings, ankle exercise devices, and floor panels.
                    The <strong>"Cutters Must"</strong> wearable and the modular floor panel system were iteratively
                    refined.
                    Early concepts included portable dance barres and basic ankle braces, eventually evolving into the
                    integrated smart system.
