                        <p>
                            As other sports and recreational activities receive an increasing amount of support for the
                            health and safety of athletes, dancers often receive little to none. There is a common
                            presumption that dancing is merely a leisurely activity; however, professional dancers
                            frequently require extensive physical therapy due to high injury incidence rates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This thesis proposes a solution to help deter the occurrence rate of injuries in young
                            professional dancers through augmented education, combining wearable technology with a smart
                            environment.

                            <strong>Smart leggings</strong> embedded with sensors track muscle engagement and alignment
                            in real-time. This wearable technology provides haptic feedback to the dancer, correcting
                            posture before injuries occur.

                        <h3>The Problem</h3>
                        <p>
                            Dance involves many repetitive motions that can cause injuries to cascade over time.
                            Unless measures are taken to reduce these rates, many young dancers face long-term physical
                            consequences.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Dancers often lack real-time feedback on their bio-mechanics
                            during practice, leading to poor form habits that cause injury.
                        </p>

                        <h3>User Research</h3>
                        <p>
                            Interviews with dancers and instructors revealed that while instructors correct form, they
                            cannot be everywhere at once. Dancers practicing alone often reinforce bad habits
                            unknowingly.

                    <h3>1. Ergonomics & Human Factors</h3>
                    <p>
                        1:1 scale studies were conducted to ensure the wearables fit diverse body types without
                        restricting movement. The placement of sensors was critical to capture accurate muscle data.

                    <h3>2. Prototyping</h3>
                    <p>
                        Physical study models were developed for the floor panels to test modularity and durability.
                        Electronics integration was tested using Arduino-based prototypes to validate sensor
                        responsiveness.
