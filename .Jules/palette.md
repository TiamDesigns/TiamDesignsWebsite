## 2026-05-17 - Keyboard Support for Div/Span Interactive Elements
**Learning:** Found an accessibility issue pattern specific to this app's components: interactive elements (like `.skill-toggle` spans) used `role="button"` and `tabindex="0"` for screen reader and keyboard focus, but lacked JavaScript `keydown` listeners, meaning they were only activatable via mouse.
**Action:** Always verify that non-button elements styled as buttons (e.g. `span`, `div` with `role="button"`) implement `keydown` event listeners for `Enter` and `Space` keys to ensure full keyboard accessibility.
