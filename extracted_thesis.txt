Abstract  
 As  other  sports  and  recreational  activities  receive  an  increasing  amount  of  support  for  the  
health
 
and
 
safety
 
of
 
the
 
athletes,
 
dancers
 
seem
 
to
 
receive
 
little
 
to
 
none.
 
Often
 
times
 
there
 
is
 
a
 
presumption
 
that
 
dancing
 
is
 
a
 
leisurely
 
activity,
 
however,
 
it
 
is
 
quite
 
a
 
common
 
occurrence
 
for
 
professional
 
dancers
 
to
 
require
 
an
 
immense
 
amount
 
of
 
physical
 
therapy
 
due
 
to
 
the
 
high
 
injury
 
incidence
 
rate.
 
Dance
 
has
 
many
 
repetitive
 
motions
 
that
 
can
 
cause
 
injuries
 
to
 
cascade
 
over
 
time.
 
Unless
 
something
 
is
 
done
 
to
 
reduce
 
the
 
occurrence
 
rate
 
of
 
dance
 
injuries
 
many
 
youths
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
later
 
stages
 
of
 
their
 
life
 
affected
 
by
 
the
 
injuries.
 
In
 
this
 
thesis,
 
a
 
solution
 
will
 
be
 
developed
 
to
 
help
 
deter
 
the
 
occurrence
 
rate
 
of
 
injuries
 
in
 
young
 
professional
 
dancers.

This  project  was  made  possible  with  the  support,  guidance  and  knowledge  of  peers,  advisors,  and  
professors.
 
I
 
would
 
like
 
to
 
thank
 
the
 
following
 
for
 
helping
 
me
 
pursue
 
this
 
thesis
 
topic
 
and
 
developing
 
me
 
as
 
a
 
designer.
 
 
 
I  would  like  to  thank  Catherine  Chong  and  Sandro  Zaccolo  for  being  the  primary  advisors  to  this  
thesis.
 
Their
 
knowledge
 
in
 
design
 
research,
 
concept
 
generation,
 
and
 
design
 
development
 
was
 
immensely
 
helpful.
 
 
 
I  would  like  to  thank  my  peers  and  fellow  classmates  for  the  feedback,  support  and  interesting  
perspectives
 
on
 
the
 
work
 
I
 
developed.
 
Often
 
they
 
served
 
as
 
the
 
most
 
immediate
 
response
 
to
 
questions
 
and
 
concerns
 
I
 
had
 
during
 
various
 
points
 
in
 
the
 
project.
 
 
 
Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  my  mother  (Jacqueline  Morrow),  whose  stories  and  experience  as  a  
dance
 
teacher
 
helped
 
drive
 
the
 
foundation
 
of
 
this
 
study.
 
I
 
hope
 
that
 
someday
 
dance
 
educators
 
receive
 
the
 
proper
 
educational
 
model
 
and
 
tools
 
required
 
to
 
prevent
 
injuries.
