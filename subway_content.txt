1  Introduction  
This  User  and  Product  Manual  (UPM)  provides  the  information  necessary  for  operators  to   
effectively
 
use
 
and
 
maintain
 
the
 
Sample
 
Subway,
 
while
 
articulating
 
the
 
prototype
 
documentation
 
for
 
reproducibility.
  
 
The  Sample  Subway  is  a  product  used  in  nuclear  reactors  to  obtain  a  metal  sample  from  the  
interior
  
of
 
the
 
fuel
 
channel
 
to
 
be
 
tested
 
for
 
hydrogen
 
embrittlement,
 
evaluating
 
the
 
integrity
 
of
 
the
 
pipe
 
composition.
 
The
 
development
 
of
 
this
 
device
 
assumes
 
operating
 
conditions
 
in
 
a
 
neutral
  
environment,
 
rather
 
than
 
nuclear
 
constraints
 
of
 
radiation,
 
pressure,
 
and
 
temperature
 
impacting
 
the
  
design
 
constraints
 
beyond

Overview
  
2.1  Scope  of  the  Project  &  Project  
The  goal  of  the  project  was  to  design  a  device  for  Canadian  Nuclear  Laboratories  (CNL)  to  
retrieve
 
a
 
metal
 
sample
 
that
 
weighs
 
30-80
 
mg
 
from
 
inside
 
a
 
15-foot-long
 
tube,
 
oriented
 
either
  
horizontally
 
or
 
vertically,
 
with
 
a
 
4-inch
 
internal
 
diameter.
 
The
 
collected
 
sample
 
will
 
be
 
transported
  
to
 
a
 
laboratory
 
to
 
test
 
for
 
hydrogen
 
embrittlement.
 
The
 
fundamental
 
user
 
requirements
 
for
 
the
 
device
  
include
 
a
 
containment
 
method
 
to
 
remove
 
direct
 
contact
 
between
 
the
 
tool
 
operator
 
and
 
the
 
sample,
  
an
 
adjustable
 
sample
 
retrieval
 
process,
 
a
 
feedback
 
control
 
system
 
to
 
detail
 
process
 
status,
 
a
 
fail-safe
  
design
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
equipment
 
failure,
 
and
 
a
 
modular
 
design
 
capable
 
of
 
being
 
broken
 
down
 
into
  
man-portable
 
sizes.
 
 
Based  on  the  general  project  requirements,  the  team  developed  the  following  problem  
statement
  
to
 
focus
 
our
 
objectives
 
throughout
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
the
 
device:
 
“Operators
 
who
 
service
 
nuclear
  
reactors
 
need
 
a
 
device
 
to
 
collect
 
metal
 
samples
 
from
 
pressure
 
tubes
 
while
 
minimizing
 
exposure
 
to
  
contaminated
 
material.
 
The
 
solution
 
should
 
be
 
compact
 
and
 
completely
 
removable
 
from
 
the
  
pressure
 
tube,
 
and
 
it
 
should
 
also
 
be
 
able
 
to
 
report
 
the
 
stage
 
of
 
operation
 
within
 
a
 
limited
 
time.”
 
 
The  Sample  Subway  is  a  device  capable  of  retrieving  a  precise  metal  sample  from  a  nuclear   
fuel
 
channel
 
including
 
traction
 
wheels
 
for
 
horizontal
 
movement
 
to
 
the
 
sampling
 
location,
 
a
 
powerful
  
scraper
 
to
 
retrieve
 
the
 
necessary
 
sample
 
mass,
 
a
 
winch
 
for
 
vertical
 
movement
 
and
 
fail-safe,
 
along
 
with
 
a
 
self-sealing
 
containment
 
system
 
to
 
keep
 
the
 
sample
 
protected
 
and
 
isolated
 
from
 
direct
 
contact
  
with
 
the
 
operator.
  
 
--- Page 6 ---
 
 Figure  5-1  -   
The  design’s  originality  focuses  on  the  user  needs  and  proposed  fully  automated  system  for  the   
horizontal
 
configuration
 
and
 
a
 
containment
 
system
 
that
 
prevents
 
any
 
contact
 
with
 
the
 
sampled
  
material.
 
Additionally,
 
the
 
device
 
consists
 
of
 
removable
 
and
 
interchangeable
 
components
 
such
 
as
  
the
 
battery
 
pack,
 
which
 
provides
 
more
 
than
 
enough
 
voltage
 
and
 
amperage
 
to
 
power
 
the
 
sampling
  
tool,
 
a
 
carbide
 
lathe
 
bit
 
that
 
serves
 
longevity
 
and
 
less
 
maintenance.
 
The
 
Sample
 
Subway
 
also
 
does
  
work
 
effectively
 
in
 
both
 
horizontal
 
and
 
vertical
 
configurations
 
putting
 
it
 
ahead
 
of
 
competitors
  
working
 
on
 
the
 
project
 
and
 
in
 
industry.

 Figure  5-2   
In  terms  of  operation,  the  device  is  placed  in  the  inlet  of  the  tube,  travels  via  motorized  wheels  or  a  
manual
 
winch
 
to
 
approximately
 
14.5
 
ft,
 
scrapes
 
the
 
circumferential
 
inner
 
diameter
 
of
 
the
 
tube
  
estimating
 
a
 
sample
 
collection
 
of
 
65
 
±
 
9.5
 
mg
 
sealed
 
inside
 
a
 
removable
 
container
 
where
 
it
 
will
  
travel
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
operator
 
once
 
a
 
desired
 
sample
 
is
 
achieved.
 
In
 
terms
 
of
 
construction,
 
the
 
device
  
can
 
be
 
categorized
 
into
 
various
 
systems:
 
power,
 
scraping,
 
movement,
 
containment,
 
fail-safe,
 
and
  
control.
 
These
 
systems
 
components
 
are
 
specified
 
as
 
follows,
 
respectively:
 
a
 
custom
 
battery
 
pack,
 
a
  
lathe
 
bit,
 
two
 
movement
 
motors
 
and
 
bearings,
 
load
 
cell,
 
a
 
custom
 
winch,
 
and
 
a
 
microcontroller.
 
The
  
system’s
 
chassis
 
is
 
made
 
of
 
3D
 
printed
 
filament
 
consisting
 
of
 
PTEG
 
and
 
PLA.
 
The
 
construction
 
of
  
the
 
device
 
utilizes
 
numerous
 
screws
 
and
 
a
 
screwdriver.
 
Further

2.3Cautions  &  Warnings   
The  battery  and  BMS  assembly  must  be  handled  with  extreme  caution.  Failure  to  exercise   
due
 
diligence
 
can
 
result
 
in
 
serious
 
harm
 
to
 
yourself
 
and
 
others.
 
If
 
you
 
are
 
unsure
 
about
 
proper
  
handling
 
practices,
 
it
 
is
 
advisable
 
to
 
find
 
an
 
alternative
 
power
 
source
 
for
 
the
 
device.
 
There
 
are
 
many
  
3S1P
 
batteries
 
available
 
on
 
the
 
market
 
for
 
hobby
 
race
 
cars
 
and
 
drones
 
that
 
can
 
serve
 
as
 
substitutes.
  
However,
 
these
 
alternatives
 
may
 
be
 
significantly
 
more
 
expensive
 
and
 
come
 
with
 
their
 
own
 
risks.
 
If
  
the
 
battery
 
ignites
 
all
 
persons
 
should
 
immediately
 
vacate
 
the
 
area,
 
and
 
emergency
 
services
 
should
  
be
 
notified.
  
 
The  scraping  tool  bit  can  become  stuck  in  the  pipe.  This  component  will  need  to  be   
iteratively
 
remodeled
 
and
 
adjusted
 
since
 
it
 
is
 
designed
 
for
 
a
 
precise
 
tube
 
diameter.
 
The
 
current
  
prototype
 
was
 
designed
 
to
 
scrape
 
a
 
4.05-inch
 
diameter
 
pipe.
 
A
 
break
 
line
 
should
 
be
 
included
 
in
 
the
  
design
 
to
 
allow
 
the
 
tool
 
bit
 
to
 
break
 
off
 
if
 
it
 
becomes
 
lodged
 
in
 
the
 
pipe.
 
Furthermore,
 
scraping
 
tests
  
with
 
the
 
device
 
should
 
be
 
conducted
 
using
 
the
 
pass-through
 
section
 
at
 
the
 
front
 
of
 
the
 
device.
 
This
  
setup
 
allows
 
for
 
easier
 
shutdown
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
a
 
critical
 
failure.
 
 
During  operation  of  the  device,  the  serial  monitor  in  the  Arduino  IDE  should  be  closely   
monitored
 
so
 
that
 
any
 
emergent
 
issues
 
can
 
be
 
handled.
 
In
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
power
 
loss,
 
the
 
device
 
will
 
have
 
to
 
be
 
forcibly
 
moved,
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
method
 
as
 
above.
 
The
 
application
 
only
 
acts
 
as
 
a
 
demo
  
and
 
does
 
not
 
directly
 
interface
 
with
 
the
 
device.
 
All
 
controls
 
will
 
be
 
through
 
the
 
serial
 
monitor.
 
 
  
--- Page 9 ---
 
Getting  started   
Below  a  general  walkthrough  of  the  system  will  be  provided.  This  will  cover  the  setup  and   
deployment
 
of
 
the
 
Sample
 
Subway,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
 
cleanup
 
and
 
storage
 
of
 
the
 
device.
 
How
 
to
  
configure
 
and
 
navigate
 
the
 
system
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
detailed.
  
 
Configuration  Considerations   
The  considerations  for  the  system's  configuration  are  dependent  on  the  orientation  of  the  fuel   
channel
 
being
 
tested,
 
either
 
vertical
 
or
 
horizontal.
 
The
 
changes
 
in
 
configuration
 
affect
 
the
  
positioning
 
of
 
the
 
containment
 
system,
 
requiring
 
an
 
additional
 
head
 
cover
 
for
 
vertical
 
pipe
 
sampling.
 
 
In  a  horizontal  orientation,  the  container  is  inserted  into  the  allocated  slot  in  parallel  with  the   
whole
 
device
 
underneath
 
the
 
scraping
 
bit,
 
while
 
the
 
lid
 
catches
 
on
 
a
 
segment
 
of
 
the
 
device
 
to
 
open
  
the
 
container,
 
as
 
seen
 
below:
 
 
 Figure  6-1   
In  a  vertical  orientation,  an  additional  head  cover  is  required  to  orient  the  container  perpendicular   
to
 
the
 
device,
 
as
 
illustrated
 
below.
 
In
 
a
 
similar
 
manner,
 
upon
 
insertion
 
of
 
the
 
container,
 
the
 
lid
  
contacts
 
a
 
segment
 
of
 
the
 
device,
 
seen
 
as
 
the
 
arced
 
component
 
on
 
the
 
flat
 
plate
 
in
 Figure  X  to  open

 Figure  6-2   
User  Access  Considerations   
The  users  for  the  sample  subway  device  include  the  operators,  the  maintenance  team  and  the   
disposal
 
team
 
for
 
a
 
CANDU
 
reactor.
 
Each
 
user/group
 
will
 
only
 
handle
 
the
 
device
 
in
 
the
 
way
 
it
 
was
  
intended
 
for
 
them
 
specifically.
 
Operators
 
will
 
handle
 
the
 
operation
 
of
 
the
 
device,
 
sending
 
the
 
sample
  
subway
 
into
 
and
 
out
 
of
 
a
 
tube
 
to
 
extract
 
a
 
sample.
 
The
 
maintenance
 
team
 
would
 
ensure
 
that
 
the
  
device
 
is
 
in
 
proper
 
working
 
order
 
(both
 
the
 
hardware
 
and
 
software)
 
and
 
ensure
 
parts
 
of
 
the
 
device
  
are
 
replaced
 
in
 
a
 
regular
 
and
 
timely
 
manner.
 
The
 
disposal
 
team
 
will
 
deal
 
with
 
the
 
proper
 
disposal
  
of
 
various
 
parts
 
(as
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
exposed
 
to
 
radiation
 
over
 
time).
 
Suppose
 
a
 
user/group
 
faces
 
issues
  
with
 
the
 
device
 
outside
 
their
 
qualifications
 
for
 
handling
 
the
 
device.
 
In
 
that
 
case,
 
they
 
should
 
consult
  
with
 
other
 
users/groups
 
qualified
 
to
 
handle
 
that
 
issue.
  
 
Accessing/setting  up  the  System   
Startup  of  the  Sample  Subway  begins  with  determining  whether  the  device  will  be  
sampling
  
in
 
the
 
vertical
 
or
 
horizontal
 
orientation.
 
If
 
the
 
horizontal
 
orientation
 
is
 
chosen,
 
the
 
operator
 
must
 
set
  
the
 
“Containment
 
System”
 
into
 
place
 
by
 
pushing
 
it
 
into
 
the
 
hole
 
located
 
at
 
the
 

--- Page 11 ---
 
bottom  of  the  devices’   tooling  head.  If  the  vertical  orientation  is  chosen,  the  operator  must  first  
attach
 
the
 
“
End
 
Cap”
 
onto
  
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
device
 
by
 
screwing
 
it
 
into
 
place
 
using
 
M3
 
bolts.
 
The
 
operator
 
can
 
then
 
insert
 
the
  
“Containment
 
System”
 
by
 
pushing
 
the
 
Containment
 
System
 
into
 
the
 
hole
 
located
 
at
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
  
the
 
End
 
Cap.
 
 Figure  6-3   
Once  the  containment  system  has  been  inserted  into  the  device,  the  device  must  be  attached  to  the   
failsafe
 
system
 
spool.
 
The
 
operator
 
must
 
do
 
this
 
by

The  Sample  Subway  is  physically  comprised  of  four  main  sections.  The  tool  head,   container,  
chassis,
 
and
 
failsafe.
 
Each
 
section
 
is
 
connected
 
to
 
another,
 
and
 
the
 
order
 
in
 
which
 
the
  
system
 
is
 
assembled
 
does
 
matter.
 
As
 
such,
 
this
 
document
 
will
 
go
 
in
 
order
 
of
 
the
 
assembly.
  
 

--- Page 17 ---
 
6.1.2  Chassis  Organization   
The  chassis  houses  the  battery  and  the  BMS  underneath  the  side  panel.  It  also  contains  all  8   
of
 
the
 
bearings
 
and
 
their
 
respective
 
mounts.
 
All
 
components
 
for
 
the
 
chassis
 
are
 
mounted
 
using
 
M3
  
x
 
6mm
 
bolts.
 
It
 
is
 
advisable
 
to
 
use
 
bolts
 
up
 
to
 
12mm
 
in
 
length
 
for
 
the
 
battery
 
holder.
 
The
 
wheels
  
are
 
slid
 
onto
 
the
 
bearings,
 
which
 
are
 
respectively
 
slid
 
onto
 
the
 
bearing
 
mounts.
 
These
 
are
 
then
 
placed
  
on
 
the
 
inner
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
chassis,
 
then
 
allowing
 
the
 
bolts
 
to
 
come
 
through
 
the
 
chassis
 
mating
 
the
  
components
 
together.
  
 
 Figure  6-12  
17   6.1.3  Toolhead  Organization   
The  toolhead  is  comprised  of  6  main  components;  the  sample  plate,  head  cover,  container   
mount,
 
tool
 
bit
 
holder,
 
tooling
 
head
 
cover,
 
white
 
tube
 
and
 
motor
 
plate.
 
The
 
sample
 
plate's
 
purpose
  

--- Page 18 ---
 
is  to  allow  for  the  mounting  of  the  head  cover  to  the  tooling  head.  Additionally,  the  plate  acts  as  a   
guide
 
that
 
allows
 
the
 
collected
 
sample
 
to
 
fall
 
into
 
the
 
containment
 
system
 
when
 
the
 
device
 
is
 
in
  
the
 
vertical
 
orientation.
 
The
 
head
 
covers
 
purpose
 
is
 
to
 
allow
 
for
 
sampling
 
collection
 
to
 
take
 
place
  
in
 
the
 
vertical
 
orientation,
 
as
 
the
 
containment
 
system
 
can
 
be
 
inserted
 
vertically
 
into
 
the
 
container
  
mount
 
when
 
the
 
head
 
cover
 
is
 
attached.
 
The
 
container
 
mount
 
allows
 
for
 
the
 
insertion
 
of
 
the
  
containment
 
system
 
into
 
the
 
tooling
 
head.
 
A
 
notch
 
located
 
on
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
the
 
container
 
mount
  
allows
 
for
 
the
 
containment
 
system
 
to
 
remain
 
open
 
while
 
sampling
 
is
 
taking
 
place.
 
The
 
tool
 
bit
  
holders'
 
purpose
 
is
 
to
 
allow
 
for
 
the
 
sampling
 
bit
 
to
 
be
 
attached
 
to
 
the
 
motor,
 
allowing
 
for
 
efficient
  
sampling
 
to
 
take
 
place.
 
The
 
tooling
 
head
 
covers
 
purpose
 
is
 
to
 
contain
 
all
 
of
 
the
 
components
  
located
 
within
 
the
 
tooling
 
head,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
protect
 
the
 
sample
 
from
 
exposure
 
while
 
sampling
 
takes
  
place.
 
The
 
white
 
tube's
 
purpose
 
is
 
to
 
allow
 
for
 
the
 
mounting
 
of
 
the
 
motor
 
plate,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
the
  
mounting
 
of
 
the
 
tooling
 
head
 
cover.
 
The
 
final
 
component,
 
the
 
motor
 
plate,
 
allows
 
for
 
the
 
sampling
  
motor
 
to
 
be
 
mounted.
 
This
 
allows
 
for
 
the
 
motor
 
shaft
 
to
 
be
 
used
 
in
 
the
 
tooling
 
head,
 
allowing
 
for
  
sampling
 
to
 
occur.
 
 
6.1.4  Failsafe  Organization   
The  failsafe  consists  of  two  main  components:  an  end  cap  which  is  attached  to  the  chassis,   
and
 
the
 
winch
 
which
 
is
 
tethered
 
to
 
the
 
end
 
cap
 
using
 
a
 
paracord
 
rope.
 
 
6.1.5  Container  Organization   
6.1.6  Software  Organization   
Sample  Subway  uses  an  app  for  operation.  This  app  allows  the  user  to  operate  the  device  (control   
its
 
movement
 
and
 
sampling),
 
know
 
its
 
current
 
state
 
of
 
operation
 
and
 
obtain
 
results.
 
The
 
app
 
begins
  
with
 
a
 
login
 
page
 
for
 
the
 
user
 
to
 
sign
 
in.
 
This
 
opens
 
the
 
menu
 
where
 
previous
 
results
 
can
 
be
  
--- Page 19 ---
 
reviewed,  and  sample  devices  can  be  connected  to.  When  a  user  connects  to  a  device  they  can  
begin
  
a
 
new
 
sample
 
collection,
 
in
 
this
 
page,
 
settings
 
for
 
the
 
device's
 
location,
 
orientation
 
and
 
mass
  
collection
 
can
 
be
 
toggled.
 
Once
 
the
 
desired
 
settings
 
are
 
confirmed,
 
the
 
user
 
is
 
brought
 
to
 
another
  
page
 
to
 
begin
 
sample
 
collection.
 
The
 
page
 
informs
 
the
 
user
 
on
 
the
 
sample
 
collection
 
progress
  
including
 
its
 
stage
 
of
 
operation
 
and
 
the
 
amount
 
of
 
sample
 
collected.
 
Finally,
 
after
 
device
 
operation
  
is
 
completed,
 
the
 
user
 
is
 
brought
 
to
 
a
 
final
 
page
 
where
 
sample
 
collection
 
results
 
are
 
displayed.
  
 
Exiting  the  System   
If  in  the  horizontal  orientation,  the  device  should  return  automatically  after  collecting  an   
appropriate
 
sample
 
size.
 
If
 
it
 
is
 
unsuccessful
 
a
 
"return”
 
command
 
can
 
be
 
issued
 
to
 
the
 
device
 
through
  
the
 
Arduino
 
IDE.
 
This
 
will
 
instruct
 
the
 
device
 
to
 
put
 
the
 
tool
 
bit
 
in
 
the
 
safe
 
position,
 
allowing
 
the
  
device
 
to
 
move
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
operator.
 
Motor
 
failure
 
can
 
occur,
 
and
 
if
 
it
 
does,
 
then
 
a
 
“stop”
 
command
  
will
 
completely
 
halt
 
all
 
operation
 
on
 
the
 
device.
 
Then
 
the
 
device
 
can
 
be
 
pulled
 
back
 
utilizing
 
the
  
winch
 
mechanism.
 
After
 
the
 
device
 
has
 
fully
 
left
 
the
 
pressure
 
tube,
 
the
 
container
 
can
 
be
 
safely
  
removed.
 
 
 
In  the  vertical  orientation,  after  sampling  the  device  will  prompt  the  operator  to  use  the   
winch.
 
After
 
the
 
operator
 
uses
 
the
 
winch
 
to
 
pull
 
the
 
device
 
back
 
up,
 
the
 
container
 
can
 
be
 
moved
  
from
 
the
 
front.
 
The
 
same
 
“stop”
 
command
 
is
 
available
 
in
 
the
 
event
 
of
 
an
 
emergency.
  
 
 
It  is  advised  to  disconnect  the  battery  before  storing  the  device.  A  stand  exists  to  prevent  
the
  
device
 
from
 
rolling
 
around
 
on
 
flat
 
surfaces.
 
The
 
container
 
can
 
now
 
be
 
used
 
independently
 
and
 
taken
  
to
 
the
 
sample
 
analysis
 
lab.

7  Using  the  System   The  following  subsections  provide  detailed,  step-by-step  instructions  on  how  to  use  the   
various
 
functions
 
or
 
features
 
of
 
the
 
Sample
 
Subway.
 
 
Functions  and  Features   
The  Sample  Subway’s  features  consist  of  4  subsystems:  movement,  sampling,  
containment,
  
and
 
failsafe.
 
The
 
respective
 
functions
 
and
 
features
 
of
 
each
 
individual
 
subsystem
 
will
 
be
 
detailed,
  
while
 
also
 
making
 
remarks
 
about
 
the
 
entire
 
operation
 
provided
 
in
 
the
 
order
 
of
 
subsystems
 
presented.
  
Before
 
operating
 
the
 
device,
 
it
 
is
 
crucial
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
orientation
 
of
 
the
 
pressure
 
tube
 
sampled,
  
which
 
can
 
be
 
horizontal
 
or
 
vertical.
 
 
7.1.1  Movement   The  orientation  of  the  pressure  tube  dictates  the  respective  subsystem  used  for  movement.   
In
 
a
 
horizontal
 
orientation,
 
the
 
device
 
is
 
manually
 
placed
 
in
 
the
 
inlet
 
of
 
the
 
pipe
 
with
 
the
 
tool
 
head
  
orienting
 
facing
 
the
 
sample
 
site.
 
Theoretically,
 
this
 
system
 
would
 
include
 
two
 
motors
 
that
 
would
  
actuate
 
the
 
bearings
 
by
 
using
 
the
 
ESP32
 
microcontroller,
 
commanded
 
by
 
the
 
operator
 
to
 
commence
  
and
 
specify
 
movement
 
to
 
the
 
sample
 
site.
 
Unfortunately,
 
the
 
horizontal
 
movement
 
--- Page 21 ---
 
features  were  not   tested,  provided  the  team  was  assigned  to  a  vertical  testing  demonstration  on  
Design
 
Day.
 
 
 
 Figure  7-1   
For  a  vertical  orientation,  the  movement  of  the  device  is  manually  operated  using  a  custom  winch,   
the
 
failsafe
 
system,
 
with
 
measurement
 
points
 
indicated
 
at
 
every
 
half
 
foot
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
distance
  
of
 
the
 
device
 
inside
 
the
 
pressure
 
tube.
 
That
 
being
 
said,
 
the
 
bearings
 
remain
 
to
 
provide
 
guidance
 
and
  
fit
 
along
 
the
 
inner
 
pipe
 
walls.
 
To
 
set
 
up
 
the
 
operation,
 
clamp
 
down
 
the
 
winch
 
to
 
a
 
nearby
 
fixed

structure  (i.e.  table).  Carefully  extend  the  paracord  up  to  the  inlet  of  the  top  of  the  pressure  tube,   
while  placing  the  device  parallelly  inside  the  inlet  with  the  tool  head  facing  the  ground.  The  
pressure
  
tube
 
plate,
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
winch
 
prevents
 
excessive
 
damage
 
and
 
friction
 
against
 
the
 
tube,
 
while
  
centering
 
the
 
controlled
 
downwards
 
movement
 
and
 
resting
 
on
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
pressure
 
tube.
 
The
  
device
 
is
 
meticulously
 
guided
 
down
 
the
 
tube,
 
acknowledging
 
the
 
depth
 
achieved
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
half
 
foot
 
measurements
 
on
 
the
 
paracord.
 
Once
 
the
 
device
 
reaches
 
the
 
desired
 
sample
 
site
 
depth,
 
it
 
must
  
be
 
held
 
in
 
place
 
by
 
the
 
operator
 
as
 
sampling
 
begins,
 
as
 
any
 
movement
 
will
 
interfere
 
with
 
the
 
sample
  
extraction
 
process.
 
22   7.1.2  Sampling   
The  sampling  system  functions  for  both  horizontal  and  vertical  testing,  however,  the  
control
  
system
 
procedure
 
to
 
commence
 
the
 
sampling
 
changes.
 
For
 
horizontal
 
testing,
 
the
 
control
 
system
 
is
  
automated
 
provided
 
the
 
detailed
 
code
 
articulating
 
the
 
command
 
to
 
start
 
the
 
motor
 
to
 
sample
 
once
  
the
 
sample
 
site
 
depth
 
is
 
reached.
 
For
 
vertical
 
testing,
 
once
 
the
 
operator
 
reaches
 
the
 
desired
 
depth
 
 
with  the  winch,  the  motor  mechanism  for  scraping  is  commanded  through  use  of  the  application  or   
the
 
ESP32
 
control
 
system.
 
As
 
the
 
containment
 
system
 
calculates
 
the
 
collected
 
mass,
 
the
  
microcontroller
 
will
 
stop
 
the
 
motor
 
once
 
the
 
tool
 
bit
 
holder
 
reaches
 
an
 
offset
 
position
 
(i.e.
 
not
 
extruded
 
from
 
device),
 
allowing
 
for
 
an
 
easy
 
and
 
controlled
 
retrieval
 
of
 
the
 
device.
 
 
7.1.3  Container   
--- Page 23 ---
 
The  containment  system  itself  can  be  defined  as  an  isolated  spring-loaded  mechanism;  the

of

 7.1.4  Failsafe   
The  fail-safe  system  has  dual  purposes,  achieving  vertical  movement  for  the  device,  while   
also
 
capable
 
of
 
removing
 
the
 
device
 
from
 
the
 
pressure
 
tube

acting
 
as
 
a
  
fail-safe
 
mechanism
 
(i.e.
 
equipment
 
failure).
 
As
 
the
 
device
 
travels
 
inside
 
of
 
the
 
tube,
 
paracord
 
is
  
directly
 
connected
 
to
 
the
 
device,
 
allowing
 
the
 
operator
 
to
 
manipulate
 
the
 
device
 
from
 
the
 
outside
  
using
 
the
 
custom
 
winch
 
without
 
any
 
direct
 
contact
 
with
 
any
 
contaminated
 
material.

Special  Considerations   
Variation  in  the  collected  mass  is  to  be  expected.  There  is  a  fair  amount  of  noise  affecting  the   
precision
 
and
 
accuracy
 
of
 
the
 
load
 
cell.
 
There
 
are
 
functions
 
that
 
were
 
used
 
to
 
improve
 
accuracy;
 
however,
 
the
 
data
 
can
 
still
 
fluctuate
 
due
 
to
 
a
 
variety
 
of
 
reasons,
 
and
 
it’s
 
likely
 
not
 
worthwhile
 
trying
  
to
 
debug
 
these
 
issues
 
with
 
the
 
prototype.
 
With
 
a
 
properly
 
shielded
 
container
 
manufactured
 
out
 
of
  
aluminum,
 
these
 
conditions
 
would
 
be
 
significantly
 
more
 
stable.
 
This
 
problem
 
is
 
simply
 
a
 
money
  
barrier.

9  Product  Documentation   
The  final  physical  prototype  was  constructed  utilizing  the  main  chassis  shell  as  the  basis  for   
all
 
other
 
components.
 
Only
 
components
 
in
 
the
 
orange
 
tool
 
head
 
require
 
a
 
specific
 
assembly
 
order.
  
All
 
other
 
components
 
can
 
be
 
assembled
 
in
 
nearly
 
every
 
order.
 
Any
 
assembly
 
conflicts
 
will
 
be
  
mentioned
 
in
 
their
 
respective
 
categories
 
in
 
section
 
6.1.3.
 
All
 
structural
 
components
 
were
 
3D
 
printed
  
using
 
either
 
PLA
 
or
 
PETG.
 
It
 
is
 
worth
 
noting
 
that
 
a
 
fully
 
functional
 
model
 
would
 
be
 
made
 
from
  
aluminum
 
to
 
improve
 
the
 
longevity
 
of
 
the
 
device
 
and
 
improve
 
resistance
 
to
 
the
 
elements.
 
Metal
 
was
  
outside
 
the
 
budget
 
and
 
scope
 
of
 
the
 
project
 
but
 
would
 
be
 
the
 
next
 
step
 
in
 
the
 
development
 
of
 
the
  
Sample
 
Subway.
  
 
A  digital  prototype  was  also  made,  using  Figma  as  the  prototyping  platform.  This  prototype   
was
 
made
 
to
 
give
 
a
 
generally
 
sense
 
as
 
to
 
how
 
the
 
user
 
flow
 
would
 
function,
 
and
 
test
 
for
 
any
 
UX
  
concerns.

  32  9.1.3  Assembly  Instructions   
The  first  component  to  assemble  most  easily  are  the  sets  of  bearing  mounted  wheels.  The   
process
 
for
 
assembling
 
a
 
bearing
 
unit
 
happens
 
in
 
4
 
steps
 
as
 
depicted
 
in
 
the
 
following
 
images.
  
 
--- Page 31 ---
 
 Figure  9-1   
 Figure  9-2   
The  wheel  can  slide  onto  the  bearing  and  fit  snuggly.  The  wheel  will  be  prevented  from  slipping   
off
 
by
 
a
 
groove
 
on
 
the
 
inner
 
diameter
 
of
 
the
 
wheel,
 
and
 
the
 
pressure
 
of
 
the
 
pipe.
 
For
 
the
 
prototype
 
 
33   we  also  wrapped  an  elastic  band  around  the  wheel,  but  utilizing  a  softer  rubber  would  allow  one  to   
avoid
 
this
 
step
 
altogether.
  
 
--- Page 32 ---
 
 Figure  9-3   
The  wheel  and  bearing  are  then  slid  onto  the  mounting  pin.  This  pin  has  a  round  and  a  flat   side.  
In
 
the
 
center
 
of
 
the
 
pin
 
a
 
bump
 
is
 
noticeable.
 
This
 
bump
 
is
 
what
 
allows
 
the
 
bearing
 
to
 
press
  
fit
 
onto
 
the
 
mount,
 
while
 
also
 
allowing
 
the
 
pin
 
to
 
sink
 
into
 
the
 
chassis
 
wall.
  
 
Figure  9-4   
Once  the  wheel  and  bearing  are  positioned  on  the  center  of  the  pin,  the  pin  can  then  be  oriented   
with
 
the
 
slots
 
located
 
on
 
the
 
chassis
 
frame.
 
 
34   
--- Page 33 ---
 
 Figure  9-5   
It  is  easier  to  install  the  wheels  before  any  other  components,  however  it  is  still  possible  to  install   
the
 
wheels
 
through
 
the
 
panel
 
cover
 
on
 
the
 
top
 
of
 
the
 
device.
 
Holding
 
the
 
flat
 
portion
 
of
 
the
 
pin
  
against
 
the
 
wall
 
of
 
the
 
chassis
 
allows
 
the
 
screw
 
holes
 
to
 
line
 
up.
 
Then
 
an
 
M3
 
screw
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
  
mate
 
the
 
components
 
together.
  
 
 Figure  9-6  
35   The  chassis  has  an  extra  component  necessary  so  that  the  length  of  the  screws  required  for   
assembly
 
were
 
not
 
excessive.
 
The
 
white
 
tube
 
component
 
below
 
uses
 
8
 
screws
 
to
 
directly
 
mate
 
the
  
--- Page 34 ---
 
white  tube  to  the  main  chassis  shell.    
 Figure  9-7   
Afterwards  the  motor  can  be  mounted  to  the  motor  plate.  These  components  are  assembled   
separately,
 
as
 
adjusting
 
the
 
motor
 
after
 
assembly
 
is
 
quite
 
difficult.
 
 
36   
--- Page 35 ---
 
 Figure  9-8   
The  motor  plate  can  be  connected  to  the  white  tube.  Use  only  the  top  and  bottom  holes.  A   
passthrough
 
window
 
will
 
be
 
aligned
 
on
 
the
 
bottom
 
of
 
the
 
plate.
 
If
 
you
 
are
 
assembling
 
to
 
test
 
the
  
scraping
 
bit,
 
it
 
is
 
advisable
 
to
 
pass
 
the
 
cables
 
for
 
power
 
through
 
this
 
window.
  
 
Figure  9-9  
37   
--- Page 36 ---
 
The  scraping  bit  is  then  able  to  be  attached  to  the  motor  mount.  In  the  following  image  the  motor   
is
 
positioned
 
with
 
the
 
blade
 
in
 
the
 
scraping
 
position.
 
It
 
is
 
likely
 
that
 
the
 
motor
 
will
 
have
 
to
 
be
  
powered
 
so
 
that
 
it
 
moves
 
the
 
scraper
 
to
 
the
 
recessed
 
position.
 
If
 
this
 
is
 
not
 
done,
 
the
 
next
 
steps
 
for
  
assembly
 
might
 
be
 
impossible
 
as
 
the
 
extended
 
scraping
 
bit
 
will
 
obstruct
 
the
 
tool
 
head
 
cover
 
from
  
sliding
 
over.
 
Make
 
sure
 
to
 
tighten
 
the
 
grub
 
screws
 
on
 
the
 
side
 
of
 
the
 
scraping
 
bit
 
holder
 
so
 
that
 
the
  
system
 
can
 
endure
 
the
 
high
 
torque
 
forces.

The  front  plate  of  the  tool  head  is  then  able  to  be  attached  to  the  tool  head  cover  using  4  more  M3   
bolts.
 
This
 
cover
 
is
 
responsible
 
for
 
guiding
 
the
 
collected
 
sample
 
to
 
the
 
container
 
and
 
allowing
 
the

to
 
be
 
adjustable.

The  container  can  now  be  mounted  for  sampling  by  inserting  the  device  through  the  front.

4
 
screws.
 
The
 
opening
 
for
 
the
 
container
 
should
 
be
 
located
 
at
 
the
 
bottom,
 
so
  
that
 
the
 
front
 
of
 
the
 
container
 
is
 
able
 
to
 
collect
 
the
 
falling
 
sample.

bolts
 
on

Testing  &  Validation   
To  validate  the  operation  of  the  device,  testing  was  conducted  on  focused  and  comprehensive   
LoFi/HiFi
 
prototypes
 
of
 
the
 
different
 
subsystems
 
and
 
the
 
system
 
as
 
a
 
whole.
 
 
For  the  sampling  subsystem,  we  tested  sample  collection  through  a  sample  weight  test  and  a  
sample
 
obtainment
 
test.
 
For
 
the
 
sample
 
weight
 
test,
 
the
 
load
 
cell
 
prototype
 
(HiFi,
 
focused)
 
was
 
conducted
  
by
 
 
For  the  sample  obtainment  test,  we  tested  whether  the  scraper  prototype  was  able  to  remove  
material
 
from
 
inside
 
the
 
tube.
 
This
 
was
 
tested
 
by
 
visually
 
inspecting
 
the
 
material
 
collected
 
from
 
the

10  Conclusions  and  Recommendations  for  Future  Work   
If  given  an  opportunity  to  redesign  the  device,  it  would  likely  be  more  strategic  to  design  
an
  
inner
 
frame
 
rather
 
than
 
working
 
with
 
a
 
shell.
 
This
 
would
 
make
 
it
 
much
 
easier
 
to
 
adjust
 
component
  
placement.
 
This
 
is
 
like
 
how
 
cars
 
are
 
designed,
 
where
 
the
 
frame
 
generally
 
gets
 
engineered
 
first,
 
while
  
the
 
shell
 
is
 
iteratively
 
designed
 
by
 
designers.

A  critical  failure  with  the  scraping  component  caused  the  device  to  be  inoperable  on  the   
testing
 
day.
 
The
 
disaster
 
could
 
have
 
been
 
prevented
 
two
 
different
 
ways.
 
The
 
device
 
could
 
have
 
been
  
externally
 
powered,
 
preventing
 
the
 
motor
 
from
 
straining
 
the
 
battery.
 
The
 
tool
 
bit
 
holder
 
also
 
could
  
have
 
been
 
designed
 
with
 
a
 
break
 
point
 
along
 
the
 
same
 
direction
 
as
 
the
 
pipe.
 
It
 
did
 
not
 
need
 
structural
  
reinforcement
 
along
 
this
 
axis,
 
and
 
a
 
break
 
line
 
would
 
allow
 
the
 
failsafe
 
mechanism
 
to
 
work
 
much
  
more
 
effectively.
  
 
With  a  few  more  months  to  work  on  this  project,  the  device  would  have  had  the  main  
chassis
  
redesigned
 
to
 
house
 
the
 
battery
 
parallel
 
to
 
the
 
device.
 
The
 
side
 
panel
 
would
 
also
 
open
 
a
 
larger
 
section
  
of
 
the
 
device,
 
allowing
 
easier
 
access
 
to
 
the
 
inner
 
workings.
 
Internal
 
power
 
rails
 
would
 
be
 
integrated
  
into
 
the
 
walls
 
of
 
the
 
shell,
 
making
 
wiring
 
the
 
device
 
significantly
 
easier
 
and
 
not
 
requiring
 
complete
  
disassembly
 
every
 
time
 
it
 
was
 
worked
 
on.
 
The
 
current
 
design
 
also
 
has
 
many
 
unnecessary
 
 
44   components.  Parts  could  be  combined,  such  as  the  cap  for  the  failsafe.  This  can  be  redesigned  into   
one
 
component,
 
however
 
for
 
the
 
initial
 
design
 
process
 
the
 
current
 
solution
 
was
 
much
 
more
 
effective
  
as
 
it
 
allowed
 
for
 
more
 
prototypes
 
to
 
be
 
tested.
  
 
The  integration  of  the  app  was  also  a  strongly  desired  feature  that  there  was  simply  no  time  to   
--- Page 44 ---
 
develop.  Having  the  device  correctly  interface  with  the  ESP32  board  would  have  been  a  very   
exciting
 
exploration.
 
With
 
the
 
time
 
available
 
the
 
only
 
functions
 
of
 
the
 
ESP32
 
were
 
to
 
run
 
the
 
motors,
  
measure
 
the
 
load
 
cell,
 
and
 
report
 
back
 
to
 
the
 
operator
 
via
 
Bluetooth
 
on
 
the
 
Arduino
 
IDE.
 
 
It  is  suggested  that  any  future  team  that  takes  up  this  project  focuses  on  consolidating  components,   
reducing
 
screw
 
count,
 
integrating
 
a
 
functional
 
application,
 
and
 
including
 
a
 
break
 
line
 
on
 
the
 
scraping
  
bit
 
holder.
 
Although
 
the
 
BMS
 
is
 
what
 
ultimately
 
failed
 
on
 
the
 
project,
 
it
 
did
 
it’s
 
intended
 
job,
 
and
 
a
  
future
 
group
 
could
 
put
 
time
 
into
 
making
 
this
 
better,
 
but
 
it
 
won’t
 
necessarily
 
result
 
in
 
an
  
improvement.
 
The
 
break
 
line
 
would
 
have
 
prevented
 
the
 
failure
 
just
 
as
 
much
 
as
 
a
 
more
 
expensive
  
BMS
 
would
 
have.
